# First ci-cd Implementation.
- Learning ci-cd, so forked the repo from 100xdevs and added my own CI pipeline that runs a build job, whenever someone makes a PR.
- Next up, let's add a build pipeline that deploys the project and see if it works.



# How to set up
- Clone the repo

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-17-final-code
```

- npm install
- Run postgres either locally or on the cloud (neon.tech)

```jsx
docker run  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

- Copy over all .env.example files to .env
- Update .env files everywhere with the right db url
- Go to `packages/db`
  - npx prisma migrate dev
  - npx prisma db seed
- Go to `apps/user-app` , run `npm run dev`
- Try logging in using phone - 1111111111 , password - alice (See `seed.ts`)
